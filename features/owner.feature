Feature: Manage owners
  In order to unclench the iron fist of my gemtatorship
  A gem owner
  Should be able to add and remove gem owners

    Scenario Outline: Gem owner user lists gem owners

      And a rubygem exists with a name of "OGem"
      And the "OGem" rubygem is owned by "original@owner.org"
      When I list the owners of gem "OGem" as "<format>" with my api key
      Then I should see "original@owner.org"
      And I should not see "new@owner.org"
